Let's assume the branch the instructed created for tracking is called 'master'.
Let's assume the branch the student created to do their work is called 'localmaster'.

Setup:

1. Fork the instructor repository from https://git.generalassemb.ly/naumz7/DATR-121

2. On your computer, clone the repository with the command:

[git clone https://git.generalassemb.ly/STUDENT/DATR-121] in Git Bash
[Press File -> Clone repository button] in SourceTree

3. On your computer, create a branch 'localmaster' (to contain student changes)

4. Give the instructor repository the name 'upstream' and student repository the name 'origin' (this likely happens automatically and is redundant).

[git remote add origin https://git.generalassemb.ly/STUDENT/DATR-121] in Git Bash
[git remote add upstream https://git.generalassemb.ly/naumz7/DATR-121] in Git Bash
[Repository -> Repository Settings -> Remotes -> Add remote] in SourceTree

5. Check that the remotes have been added correctly.

[git remote -v] in Git Bash
[Repository -> Repository Settings -> Remotes] in SourceTree


Regular:

1. Ensure you are in the 'localmaster' branch (this is where you should always be when working)

[Check that your terminal says 'localmaster'] in Git Bash
[Check that your or bold] in SourceTree

2. Switch to the 'master' branch (to prepare to download new lesson content)

[git checkout master] in Git Bash
[Double click on the branch name] in SourceTree

3. Git pull from the instructor repo 'master' branch into your 'master' branch (to get new lesson content)

[git pull upstream master] in Git Bash
[Click Pull button, make sure to choose 'upstream' remote repository] in SourceTree


4. Switch to the 'localmaster' branch (to come back to the version with your changes)

[git checkout localmaster] in Git Bash
[Double click name of the branch] in SourceTree

5. Merge the 'master' branch into the 'localmaster' branch. (getting the new lesson content into your working branch)

[git merge master] in Git Bash
[Right click on the latest commit in the 'master' branch and select Merge] in SourceTree

6. Continue working!

7. Push your changes to the student repository.

[git push --all origin] in Git Bash
[Click on Push, ensure remote is set to origin] in SourceTree
